            <h2><strong>Making dams work again!</strong></h2>
            <p>The WET-tool simulates how dams will perform under different farm management, geographic, and climatic
                scenarios providing dam water intelligence to boost farm resilience under dry and changing
                climates.</p>
            <p>The WET-tool is being developed by the Centre for Water and Spatial Sciences at The University of Western
                Austrlia.</p>
            <p>We're just getting started, we'd love your feedback to shape it's development!</p>
